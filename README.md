# scalay-io: Useful Scala I/O libraries

## Goal of this project 

Scalay-io project aims to provide useful Scala I/O libraries.
Now, scala.io cannot be used for general purpose.  Then, I decided to write 
useful I/O library for Scala.

This project *doesn't* aim to provide *thin* wrapper to java.io.  
I think that java.io is clumsy to use and should be cut off dependence on it.  
In scalay-io, without some exceptions, users don't need to know about java.io.

## Current Status

Now, this project is quite primitive and a few Scala codes exists.
Until an year later, I would like to release the first Î± version of scalay-io.
