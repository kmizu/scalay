# Scalay: Useful Scala libraries(especially I/O)

## Goal of this project 

Scalay project aims to provide useful Scala libraries, especially I/O.
Now, scala.io cannot be used for general purpose.  Then, I decided to
write useful I/O library for Scala.

This project *doesn't* aim to provide *thin* wrapper to java.io.  
I think that java.io is clumsy to use and should be cut off 
dependence on it.  In scalay, without some exceptions, users don't 
need to know about java.io.

## Current Status

Now, this project is quite primitive and no Scala codes at this 
repository yet.  Until a month later, I would like to release 
alpha version of scalay.
